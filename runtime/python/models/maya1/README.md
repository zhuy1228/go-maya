# Maya1

**Maya1** is a state-of-the-art speech model for expressive voice generation, built to capture real human emotion and precise voice design.

**try it:** [Playground](https://www.mayaresearch.ai/studio)

**What it does:**
- Create any voice you can imagine — a 20s British girl, an American guy, or a full-blown demon.
- Make it feel real with emotion tags: laugh, cry, whisper, rage, sigh, gasp.
- It streams instantly, sounds alive, 3B parameters, runs on single GPU
- Outperforms top proprietary models. and Developed by Maya Research.

## Why Maya1 is Different: Voice Design Features That Matter

### 1. Natural Language Voice Control
Describe voices like you would brief a voice actor:
```
<description="40-year-old, warm, low pitch, conversational">
```

No complex parameters. No training data. Just describe and generate.

### 2. Inline Emotion Tags for Expressive Speech
Add emotions exactly where they belong in your text:
```
Our new update <laugh> finally ships with the feature you asked for.
```

**Supported Emotions:** `<laugh>` `<sigh>` `<whisper>` `<angry>` `<giggle>` `<chuckle>` `<gasp>` `<cry>` and 12+ more.

### 3. Streaming Audio Generation
Real-time voice synthesis with SNAC neural codec (~0.98 kbps). Perfect for:
- Voice assistants
- Interactive AI agents
- Live content generation
- Game characters
- Podcasts and audiobooks

### 4. Production-Ready Infrastructure
- Runs on single GPU
- vLLM integration for scale
- Automatic prefix caching for efficiency
- 24 kHz audio output
- WebAudio compatible for browser playback

### Advanced: Production Streaming with vLLM

For production deployments with real-time streaming, use our vLLM script:

**Download:** [vllm_streaming_inference.py](https://huggingface.co/maya-research/maya1/blob/main/vllm_streaming_inference.py)

**Key Features:**
- Automatic Prefix Caching (APC) for repeated voice descriptions
- WebAudio ring buffer integration
- Multi-GPU scaling support
- Sub-100ms latency for real-time applications

## Technical Excellence: What Makes Maya1 the Best

### Architecture: 3B-Parameter Llama Backbone for Voice

We pretrained a **3B-parameter decoder-only transformer** (Llama-style) to predict **SNAC neural codec tokens** instead of raw waveforms.

**The Flow:**
```
<description="..."> text → tokenize → generate SNAC codes (7 tokens/frame) → decode → 24 kHz audio
```

**Why SNAC?** Multi-scale hierarchical structure (≈12/23/47 Hz) keeps autoregressive sequences compact for real-time streaming at ~0.98 kbps.

### Training Data: What Makes Our Voice AI the Best

**Pretraining:** Internet-scale English speech corpus for broad acoustic coverage and natural coarticulation.

**Supervised Fine-Tuning:** Proprietary curated dataset of studio recordings with:
- Human-verified voice descriptions
- 20+ emotion tags per sample
- Multi-accent English coverage
- Character and role variations

**Data Pipeline Excellence:**
1. 24 kHz mono resampling with -23 LUFS normalization
2. VAD silence trimming with duration bounds (1-14s)
3. Forced alignment (MFA) for clean phrase boundaries
4. MinHash-LSH text deduplication
5. Chromaprint audio deduplication
6. SNAC encoding with 7-token frame packing

### Voice Design Experiments: Why Natural Language Won

We tested 4 conditioning formats. Only one delivered production-quality results:

**❌ Colon format:** `{description}: {text}` - Format drift, model spoke descriptions

**❌ Angle-list attributes:** `<{age}, {pitch}, {character}>` - Too rigid, poor generalization

**❌ Key-value tags:** `<age=40><pitch=low>` - Token bloat, brittle to mistakes

**✅ XML-attribute (WINNER):** `<description="40-yr old, low-pitch, warm">` - Natural language, robust, scalable

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What makes Maya1 different?**  
A: We're the only open source model offering 20+ emotions, zero-shot voice design, production-ready streaming, and 3B parameters—all in one package.

**Q: Can I use this commercially?**  
A: Absolutely. Apache 2.0 license. Build products, deploy services, monetize freely.

**Q: What languages does it support?**  
A: Currently English with multi-accent support. Future models will expand to languages and accents underserved by mainstream voice AI.

**Q: How does it compare to ElevenLabs, Murf.ai, or other closed-source tools?**  
A: Feature parity with emotions and voice design. Advantage: you own the deployment, pay no per-second fees, and can customize the model.

**Q: Can I fine-tune on my own voices?**  
A: Yes. The model architecture supports fine-tuning on custom datasets for specialized voices.

**Q: What GPU do I need?**  
A: Single GPU with 16GB+ VRAM (A100, H100, or consumer RTX 4090).

**Q: Is streaming really real-time?**  
A: Yes. SNAC codec enables sub-100ms latency with vLLM deployment.

## Why We Build Open Source Voice AI

Voice AI will be everywhere, but it's fundamentally broken for 90% of the world. Current voice models only work well for a narrow slice of English speakers because training data for most accents, languages, and speaking styles simply doesn't exist.

**Maya Research** builds emotionally intelligent, native voice models that finally let the rest of the world speak. We're open source because we believe voice intelligence should not be a privilege reserved for the few.

**Technology should be open** - The best voice AI tools should not be locked behind proprietary APIs charging per-second fees.

**Community drives innovation** - Open source accelerates research. When developers worldwide can build on our work, everyone wins.

**Voice intelligence for everyone** - We're building for the 90% of the world ignored by mainstream voice AI. That requires open models, not closed platforms.
